# Contributing to UBOP

UBOP is an archived research project documenting an early attempt at defining a universal booking and ordering protocol for agents. Contributions are welcome only for documentation fixes, clarifications, and historical corrections. No new features are being developed.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch describing your change.
3. Make small, focused commits.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation of:
   - what you changed,
   - why it improves the documentation or clarity,
   - and any relevant supporting references.

## What Contributions Are Accepted

Accepted:
- documentation improvements  
- typo fixes  
- clarification of examples

Not accepted:
- new UBOP features

UBOP is archived to preserve its historical design, not to evolve into a competing standard.
